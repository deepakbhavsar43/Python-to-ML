## Loops (While ,for)
- A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement :

![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/loop_architecture.jpg)
Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements.

- Types of loops in python:

![](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/python-160403194613/95/python-39-638.jpg?cb=1459712862)

### for loop in Python
- The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.
- Syntax of for Loop:

```sh
for val in sequence:
	Body of for
```
- **Example :** Python for Loop

```sh
# Program to find the sum of all numbers stored in a list
# List of numbers
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11]
# variable to store the sum
sum = 0
# iterate over the list
for val in numbers:
	sum = sum+val
# Output: The sum is 48
print("The sum is", sum)
```

##### Output :

```sh
The sum is 48
```
### for loop with else
- A for loop can have an optional else block as well. The **else** part is executed if the items in the sequence used in for loop exhausts.

```sh
digits = [0, 1, 5]
for i in digits:
    print(i)
else:
    print("No items left.")
```
##### Output :

```sh
0
1
5
No items left.
```
## Break and Continue statements
-  **break statement** can be used to stop a for loop.

```sh
name = ["Deepak", "Arun", "Bhavsar"]
for x in name:
  print(x) 
  if x == "Arun":
    break
```
##### Output :

```sh
C:\Users\deepak.bhavsar\Desktop>python 1.py
Deepak
Arun
```

- **continue statement** can be used to stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:

```sh
name = ["Deepak", "Arun", "Bhavsar"]
for x in name:
	if x == "Arun":
		# print(x)
		continue
	print(x) 
```
##### Output :

```sh
C:\Users\deepak.bhavsar\Desktop>python 1.py
Deepak
Bhavsar
```

### Nested Loops
- A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. 
- The "**inner loop**" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "**outer loop**":

```sh
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
```

##### Output :

```sh
red apple
red banana
red cherry
big apple
big banana
big cherry
tasty apple
tasty banana
tasty cherry
```
- for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the **pass statement** to avoid getting an error.

```sh
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
# having an empty for loop like this, would raise an error without the pass statement
```


## Conditions (If else,if-elif-else)
- Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
- The if…elif…else statement is used in Python for decision making.
- Here, the program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the text expression is True.


- **Python if Statement**
- If the text expression is False, the statement(s) is not executed.
- Python if Statement Flowchart

![](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Python_if_statement.jpg)

- Example of Python if Statement

```sh
# If the number is positive, we print an appropriate message
num = 3
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is always printed.")
num = -1
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is also always printed.")
```
##### Output :

```sh
3 is a positive number
This is always printed
This is also always printed.
```
- **Python if...else Statement**
- The if..else statement evaluates test expression and will execute body of if only when test condition is True.
- If the condition is False, body of else is executed. Indentation is used to separate the blocks.

![](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Python_if_else_statement.jpg)

- Example of if...else

```sh
# Program checks if the number is positive or negative
# And displays an appropriate message
num = 3
# Try these two variations as well. 
# num = -5
# num = 0
if num >= 0:
    print("Positive or Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```
##### Output :
```sh
C:\Users\deepak.bhavsar\Desktop>python 1.py
Positive or Zero
```
- In the above example, when num is equal to 3, the test expression is true and body of if is executed and body of else is skipped.
- If num is equal to -5, the test expression is false and body of else is executed and body of if is skipped.
- If num is equal to 0, the test expression is true and body of if is executed and body of else is skipped.


- **Python if...elif...else Statement**
- The elif is short for else if. It allows us to check for multiple expressions.
- If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on.
- If all the conditions are False, body of else is executed.
- Only one block among the several if...elif...else blocks is executed according to the condition.
- The if block can have only one else block. But it can have multiple elif blocks.

![](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Python_if_elif_else_statement.jpg)

- Example of if...elif...else

```sh
# In this program, 
# we check if the number is positive or
# negative or zero and 
# display an appropriate message

num = 3.4

# Try these two variations as well:
# num = 0
# num = -4.5

if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

##### Output :
```sh
Positive number
```
- When variable num is positive, Positive number is printed.
- If num is equal to 0, Zero is printed.
- If num is negative, Negative number is printed


- **Python Nested if statements**
- We can have a if...elif...else statement inside another if...elif...else statement. This is called nesting in computer programming.

- Python Nested if Example

```sh
# In this program, we input a number
# check if the number is positive or
# negative or zero and display
# an appropriate message
# This time we use nested if
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
if num >= 0:
    if num == 0:
        print("Zero")
    else:
        print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```
##### Output :
```sh
#Output 1
Enter a number: 5
Positive number

#Output 2
Enter a number: -1
Negative number

#Output 3
Enter a number: 0
Zero
```

## List of Inbuilt Modules
- A module is a file containing definitions of functions, classes, variables, constants or any other Python objects. Contents of this file can be made available to any other program.
- Built-in modules are written in C and integrated with the Python interpreter. Each built-in module contains resources for certain system-specific functionalities such as OS management, disk IO, etc.
- Below image shows all the inbuilt modules in python

![](http://xahlee.info/python/i/pydoc3_modules_2019-03-12_rrvw5.png)

### Python - OS Module
- It is possible to automatically perform many operating system tasks.
- The OS module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.


- **Creating Directory**
- We can create a new directory using the **mkdir()** function from the OS module.

```sh
>>> import os
>>>os.mkdir("d:\\tempdir")
```
- **Changing the Current Working Directory**
- We must first change the current working directory to a newly created one before doing any operations in it. This is done using the **chdir()** function.

```sh
>>> import os
>>>os.chdir("d:\\tempdir")
```
- There is a **getcwd()** function in the OS module using which we can confirm if the current working directory has been changed or not.

```sh
>>>os.getcwd()
'd:\\tempdir'
```

- Directory paths can also be relative. If the current directory is set to D drive and then to tempdir without mentioning the preceding path, then also the current working directory will be changed to d:\tempdir.

```sh
>>>os.chdir("d:\\")
>>>os.getcwd()
'd:\\'
>>>os.chdir("tempdir")
>>>os.getcwd()
'd:\\tempdir
```

- In order to set the current directory to the parent directory use ".." as the argument in the chdir() function.

```sh
>>>os.chdir("d:\\tempdir")
>>>os.getcwd()
'd:\\tempdir'
>>>os.chdir("..")
>>>os.getcwd()
'd:\\'
```

- **Removing a Directory**
- The **rmdir()** function in the OS module removes the specified directory either with an absolute or relative path. 
- we can not remove the current working directory. Also, for a directory to be removed, it should be empty.

```sh
>>>os.chdir("tempdir")
>>>os.getcwd()
'd:\\tempdir'
>>>os.rmdir("d:\\tempdir")
PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'd:\\tempdir'
>>>os.chdir("..")
>>>os.rmdir("tempdir")
```
- **List Files and Sub-directories**
- The listdir() function returns the list of all files and directories in the specified directory.

```sh
>>>os.listdir("c:\python37")
['DLLs', 'Doc', 'fantasy-1.py', 'fantasy.db', 'fantasy.py', 'frame.py', 'gridexample.py', 'include', 'Lib', 'libs', 'LICENSE.txt', 'listbox.py', 'NEWS.txt', 'place.py', 'players.db', 'python.exe', 'python3.dll', 'python36.dll', 'pythonw.exe', 'sclst.py', 'Scripts', 'tcl', 'test.py', 'Tools', 'tooltip.py', 'vcruntime140.dll', 'virat.jpg', 'virat.py']
```

- If we dont specify any directory, then list of files and directories in the current working directory will be returned.

```sh
>>>os.listdir()
['.config', '.dotnet', 'python']
```

### Python - Math Module
- Some of the most popular mathematical functions are defined in the math module.
- These include trigonometric functions, representation functions, logarithmic functions, angle conversion functions, etc.
- In addition, two mathematical constants are also defined in this module.
- Pie (π) is a well-known mathematical constant, which is defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle and its value is 3.141592653589793.

```sh
>>> import math
>>>math.pi
3.141592653589793
```
- Another well-known mathematical constant defined in the math module is e. It is called Eulers number and it is a base of the natural logarithm. Its value is 2.718281828459045.

```sh
>>>math.e
2.718281828459045
```

- The math module contains functions for calculating various trigonometric ratios for a given angle.
- The functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.) need the angle in radians as an argument.
- The math module presents two angle conversion functions: degrees() and radians(), to convert the angle from degrees to radians and vice versa.
- For example, the following statements convert the angle of 30 degrees to radians and back (Note: π radians is equivalent to 180 degrees).

```sh
>>>math.radians(30)
0.5235987755982988
>>>math.degrees(math.pi/6)
29.999999999999996
```
- The following statements show sin, cos and tan ratios for the angle of 30 degrees (0.5235987755982988 radians):

```sh
>>math.sin(0.5235987755982988)
0.49999999999999994
>>>math.cos(0.5235987755982988)
0.8660254037844387
>>>math.tan(0.5235987755982988)
0.5773502691896257
```
- You may recall that sin(30)=0.5, cos(30)=32 (which is 0.8660254037844387) and tan(30)= 13 (which is 0.5773502691896257).

- **math.log()**
- The math.log() method returns the natural logarithm of a given number. The natural logarithm is calculated to the base e.

```sh
>>>math.log(10)
2.302585092994046
math.log10()
```

- The math.log10() method returns the base-10 logarithm of the given number. It is called the standard logarithm.

```sh
>>>math.log10(10)
1.0
```

- **math.exp()**
- The math.exp() method returns a float number after raising e (math.e) to given number. In other words, exp(x) gives e**x.

```sh
>>>math.exp(10)
1.0
```
- This can be verified by the exponent operator.

```sh
>>>math.e**10
22026.465794806703
```

- **math.pow()**
- The math.pow() method receives two float arguments, raises the first to the second and returns the result. In other words, pow(4,4) is equivalent to 4**4.

```sh
>>>math.pow(2,4)
16.0
>>>2**4
16
```

- **math.sqrt()**
- The math.sqrt() method returns the square root of a given number.

```sh
>>>math.sqrt(100)
10.0
>>>math.sqrt(3)
1.7320508075688772
```

- The following two functions are called representation functions.
- The **ceil()** function approximates the given number to the smallest integer, greater than or equal to the given floating point number.
- The **floor()** function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number.

```sh
>>>math.ceil(4.5867)
5
>>>math.floor(4.5687)
4
```

### Python - Statistics Module
- The statistics module provides functions to mathematical statistics of numeric data.
- The following popular statistical functions are defined in this module.
- The **mean()** method calculates the arithmetic mean of the numbers in a list.

```sh
>>> import statistics
>>>statistics.mean([2,5,6,9])
5.5
```
- The median() method returns the middle value of numeric data in a list.

```sh
>>> import statistics
>>>statistics.median([1,2,3,8,9])
3
>>>statistics.median([1,2,3,7,8,9])
5.0
```
- The mode() method returns the most common data point in the list.

```sh
>>> import statistics
>>>statistics.mode([2,5,3,2,8,3,9,4,2,5,6])
2
```
- The stdev() method calculates the standard deviation on a given sample in the form of a list.

```sh
>>> import statistics
>>>statistics.stdev([1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5])
1.3693063937629153
```

## Procedural programming approach in Python
- The procedural style relies on procedure calls to create modularized code.
- This approach simplifies your application code by breaking it into small pieces that a developer can view easily.
- Here’s an example of the procedural coding style using my_list:

```sh
def do_add(any_list):
    sum = 0
    for x in any_list:
        sum += x
    return sum
print(do_add(my_list))
```
- The use of a function, do_add(), simplifies the overall code in this case. 
- The execution is still systematic, but the code is easier to understand because it is broken into chunks.
