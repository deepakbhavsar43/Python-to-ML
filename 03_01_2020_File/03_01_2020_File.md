## File IO in Python
- File is a named location on disk to store related information. It is used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory (e.g. hard disk).
- Since, random access memory (RAM) is volatile which loses its data when computer is turned off, we use files for future use of the data.
- When we want to read from or write to a file we need to open it first. When we are done, it needs to be closed, so that resources that are tied with the file are freed.
- Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order.
1. Open a file
2. Read or write (perform operation)
3. Close the file

#### **How to open a file?**
- Python has a built-in function **open()** to open a file. This function returns a file object, also called a handle, as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly.

```sh
>>> f = open("test.txt")    # open file in current directory
>>> f = open("C:/Python33/README.txt")  # specifying full path
```

- We can specify the mode while opening a file. In mode, we specify whether we want to read '**r**', write '**w**' or append '**a**' to the file. We also specify if we want to open the file in text mode or binary mode.
- The default is reading in text mode. In this mode, we get strings when reading from the file.
- On the other hand, binary mode returns bytes and this is the mode to be used when dealing with non-text files like image or exe files.

- the default encoding is platform dependent. In windows, it is 'cp1252' but 'utf-8' in Linux.
- So, we must not also rely on the default encoding or else our code will behave differently in different platforms.
- Hence, when working with files in text mode, it is highly recommended to specify the encoding type.

```sh
f = open("test.txt",mode = 'r',encoding = 'utf-8')
```
#### **How to close a file Using Python?**
- Closing a file will free up the resources that were tied with the file and is done using Python **close()** method.
- Python has a garbage collector to clean up unreferenced objects but, we must not rely on it to close the file.

```sh
f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
# perform file operations
f.close()
```
- A safer way is to use a try...finally block.

```sh
try:
   f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
   # perform file operations
finally:
   f.close()
```
- This way, we are guaranteed that the file is properly closed even if an exception is raised, causing program flow to stop.
- The best way to do this is using the with statement. This ensures that the file is closed when the block inside with is exited.
- We don't need to explicitly call the close() method. It is done internally.

```sh
with open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
   # perform file operations
```

## File Reading Writing
#### How to write to File Using Python?
- In order to write into a file in Python, we need to open it in write **w**, append **a** or exclusive creation **x** mode.
- We need to be careful with the **w** mode as it will overwrite into the file if it already exists. All previous data are erased.
- Writing a string or sequence of bytes (for binary files) is done using **write()** method. This method returns the number of characters written to the file.

```sh
with open("test.txt",'w',encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
   f.write("my first file\n")
   f.write("This file\n\n")
   f.write("contains three lines\n")
```
- This program will create a new file named 'test.txt' if it does not exist. If it does exist, it is overwritten.
 -We must include the newline characters ourselves to distinguish different lines.

#### How to read files in Python?
 -To read a file in Python, we must open the file in reading mode.
- There are various methods available for this purpose.
- We can use the **read(size)** method to read in size number of data.
- If size parameter is not specified, it reads and returns up to the end of the file.

```sh
>>> f = open("test.txt",'r',encoding = 'utf-8')
>>> f.read(4)    # read the first 4 data
'This'
>>> f.read(4)    # read the next 4 data
' is '
>>> f.read()     # read in the rest till end of file
'my first file\nThis file\ncontains three lines\n'
>>> f.read()  # further reading returns empty sting
' '
```
- We can see that, the **read()** method returns newline as '\n'.
Once the end of file is reached, we get empty string on further reading.
- We can change our current file cursor (position) using the **seek()** method. Similarly, the **tell()** method returns our current position (in number of bytes).

```sh
>>> f.tell()    # get the current file position
56
>>> f.seek(0)   # bring file cursor to initial position
0
>>> print(f.read())  # read the entire file
This is my first file
This file
contains three lines
```
- We can read a file line-by-line using a for loop. This is both efficient and fast.

```sh
>>> for line in f:
...     print(line, end = '')
...
This is my first file
This file
contains three lines
```
- The lines in file itself has a newline character '\n'.
- Moreover, the print() end parameter to avoid two newlines when printing.
- Alternately, we can use **readline()** method to read individual lines of a file.
- This method reads a file till the newline, including the newline character.

```sh
>>> f.readline()
'This is my first file\n'
>>> f.readline()
'This file\n'
>>> f.readline()
'contains three lines\n'
>>> f.readline()
''
```
- Lastly, the readlines() method returns a list of remaining lines of the entire file. All these reading method return empty values when end of file (EOF) is reached.

```sh
>>> f.readlines()
['This is my first file\n', 'This file\n', 'contains three lines\n']
```
